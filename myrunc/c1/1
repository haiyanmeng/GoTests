I started a runc container first, then started another container.  The second
container tried to join the `user` and `pid` namespace of the first container.

The first container got started successfully, however, the second container was
failed to be started with the following error:

    [hmeng@localhost c2]$ sudo $(which runc) run test1
    process_linux.go:245: running exec setns process for init caused "exit status 1"

The strace log of the second container shows that `setns` failed to join the
user namespace of the first container.

Here is `config.json` of the first container:

The `rootfs` I used for both of the two container are the busybox one:

    docker export $(docker create busybox) | tar -C rootfs -xvf -

I am running Fedora 23 (Workstation Edition), and here is the kernel info:
